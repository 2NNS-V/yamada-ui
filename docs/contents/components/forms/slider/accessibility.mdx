  `Slider` is a component used for allowing users to select a value from a
  range.

The `Slider` follows the [WAI-ARIA - Slider Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider/) for accessibility.

If the value of `aria-valuenow` is not user-friendly, e.g., the day of the week is represented by a number, setting `aria-valuetext` to a string that makes the slider value understandable like `"Monday"` will be read by screen reader.

```tsx live=false
const weekday = [
  "Sunday",
  "Monday",
  "Tuesday",
  "Wednesday",
  "Thursday",
  "Friday",
  "Saturday",
]

const [value, onChange] = useState<number>(0)

return (
  <Slider
    aria-valuetext={weekday[value]}
    max={6}
    min={0}
    value={value}
    onChange={onChange}
  />
)
```
